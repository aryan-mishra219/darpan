# D.A.R.P.A.N User Manual & Step-by-Step Feature Guide

---

## 1. Project Introduction: What is D.A.R.P.A.N?

**D.A.R.P.A.N** (*Digital Advanced Recommendation for Procurement and Allied Norms*) is an AI-powered procurement intelligence and standards compliance platform built for the **Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS)**.

The home portal has two working modes: **Recommender** maps a product or tender description to primary and allied standards, while **Procurement Chat** provides conversational guidance, compliance analysis, laboratory search, and document assistance.

### What Problem Does It Solve?
Indian technical standards, Quality Control Orders (QCOs), certification schemes (ISI Mark, CRS, Hallmark), and laboratory testing guidelines are dense, multi-page statutory documents. For micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs), startups, importers, and consumers, navigating these regulations is often overwhelming, slow, and prone to costly non-compliance penalties.

### What Does It Do?
1. **Translates Complex Standards**: Converts thousands of pages of BIS standards (e.g., IS 14543 for Drinking Water, IS 16102 for LED Bulbs, IS 1786 for Steel, IS 9873 for Toys) into plain-language advice, interactive checklists, and visual timelines.
2. **Proactive Compliance Audits**: Analyzes product spec sheets, flags regulatory gaps, identifies required in-house test equipment, estimates lab test costs, and generates official downloadable compliance audit PDF reports.
3. **Multimodal Vision Label Verification**: Reads product labels via camera/image upload, extracts mineral and safety values via OCR, and builds 5-column comparison tables against statutory limits.
4. **Pan-India Laboratory Locator**: Features an interactive, Survey of India (SOI) compliant map and directory of all BIS Central, Regional, Branch, and NABL-accredited testing facilities with instant sample test booking requisitions.
5. **Hallmark & HUID Authenticity Verification**: Instantly validates 6-character gold/silver HUID stamps, displays Assaying Centre credentials, and calculates real-time melt values and scrap worth.

# D.A.R.P.A.N — BIS Indian Standards Technical Reference Corpus (v1)
**Purpose:** Source-grounded RAG ingestion document covering the Top 50 Indian Standards across 10 product categories.
**Methodology note (read before ingesting):** Every fact below is either (a) drawn from a cited public source — BIS circulars, PIB releases, gazette QCOs, or verified secondary technical references — or (b) explicitly marked `[Verify against official IS document]` where the exact clause number or numeric limit sits behind BIS's paid standard document and could not be confirmed from public sources. **Do not let the LLM "fill in" the flagged fields during embedding or generation — treat the flag itself as retrievable content**, so the assistant tells the user "this exact figure needs verification from the official IS document" instead of guessing.

## 11. Related IT / Equivalent Cross-Reference Standards (mentioned in category 6 list from problem set)

*Note: The original 50-item list had a numbering duplication (two entries labelled "category 4" and "category 9" missing) — Chemicals/LPG/Domestic Safety (originally mislabeled "#9") and Renewable Energy (originally "#10") have been correctly placed above under their own headings 9 and 10. If your source list intended additional distinct standards beyond the 47 uniquely identifiable IS numbers actually provided, flag those for a follow-up research pass — three of the originally listed 50 slots referenced categories that overlapped in the source numbering.*

## 12. CROSS-CUTTING: BIS MSME FEE CONCESSION FRAMEWORK (applies across all categories above)

This is the master concession structure your Fee Estimator feature (and any certification-guidance answer) should reference:

| Enterprise Category | Fee Concession | Basis |
|---|---|---|
| Micro-scale enterprises | **80%** concession on certification/marking fees | BIS notification under Scheme-I §5(2), Scheme-II §5(6), Scheme-IV §5(2) of BIS (Conformity Assessment) Regulations, 2018 |
| Small-scale enterprises | **50%** concession | Same regulatory basis |
| Medium-scale enterprises | **20%** concession | Same regulatory basis |
| DPIIT-recognized Start-ups | **80%** concession (aligned with micro-scale treatment) | Same notification |
| Women-entrepreneur MSMEs | **Additional 10%** concession on top of the applicable category concession | Same notification |
| Existing licensees (renewal, micro-scale) | Additional 10% concession on annual minimum marking fee | PIB / BIS circular |

**Eligibility documentation**: Udyam Registration Certificate (for MSME classification, per MSME Development Act 2006) and/or DPIIT Certificate of Eligible Business (under Section 80-IAC, Income Tax Act 1961) for start-ups.

**Important currency note**: These concessions were extended through a window originally set to expire **31 May 2026**. As of a recent government statement, BIS has **moved a proposal to extend these concessions by a further three years** beyond the mid-2026 deadline — this had not been finalized as of the source reporting date. **Your assistant should treat this expiry date as a live variable and re-check it periodically rather than hardcoding "valid until May 2026" into responses**, since the extension proposal may or may not have been approved by the time your system is actually used by judges/consumers.

**Sources for this section**: PIB press releases (static.pib.gov.in), BIS circular CMD-2/G-18 (24 May 2023) as reported via secondary regulatory-advisory sources, and Outlook Business reporting on the proposed extension.
